	In this project, we modeled a sales management database system, which can serve as a good candidate to optimally accommodate and manage all the requisite information for a ‘House Builder Company’. The project span has been segregated in three phases: conceptual database design (Phase I), logical database design (Phase II), relational database implementation (Phase III).<br/>
&#8226;	Designed the overall Extended ER Schema, by analyzing the behaviors and flow management of the given requirements.<br/>
&#8226;	Translated the ER schema to the relational object model, creating a generalized schema which can be implemented on any relational database system.<br/>
&#8226;	Scripted the different part of relational model which included steps like creating Tables, Views and Procedures using PL SQL. <br/>
&#8226;	Optimized the database by using standard normalization technique.
